    "## __Prelude: Peer-to-peer (P2P) vs centralized exchanges__\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers will likely be immediately familiar with the lines and charts offered on a typical exchange. A typical exchange maintains an orderbook of *bids* and *asks*, and automatically executes trades by matching buyers and sellers whenever bidding and asking prices collide. Trading on typical exchanges focuses around high-speed execution, and price speculation. It is not uncommon to see additional derivative features on offer such as margin lending, or contracts-for-difference (CFD's) aimed at technical analysis day traders.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust required to make it work.\"\n",
    "- Satoshi nakomoto\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized exchanges are such named as they provide a central point in which local currency is aggregated. They maintain bank account which users wire funds to, and receive funds from. Although some are decentralized, most also aggregate the cryptocurrency of their users into company-owned wallets. Trading on a centralised exchange involves sending your funds to the exchange, and trusting that they will be kept safe on your behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, centralised exchanges raise important questions as regards privacy and security, as well as the growing corporate monopolisation of a cultural space whose ethos centers around decentralization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many have been the victim of hacking or large scale theft, and many users have had their local currency seized or frozen for various reasons ranging from accusations of criminality, to simple inability to provide sufficient documentation to satisfy regulatory agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralised exchanges also have stringent KYC requirements, which require users to send personal identity documentation to the exchange. In the past there have been leaks of this information - leaving users of the exchange susceptible to identity theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "A peer-to-peer exchange provides no central aggregation of local currency. In a style akin to eBay, traders on the exchange create advertisements (called offers) which indicate which cryptocurrency they wish to buy or sell. Other traders contact them, and the exchange acts only to safeguard the process of users trading with each other - by providing an escrow service for the cryptocurrency being traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "By decentralizing the local currency funds, the peer-to-peer exchange has no ability to seize the fiat currency of users. Most importantly however, a peer-to-peer exchange enables large-scale accessibility of cryptocurrency to mainstream users in a way impossible for a centralized exchange to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement of centralized exchanges to maintain bank accounts requires them to be heavily restrictive on which payment methods they can offer, and which locations they can accept users.\n",
    "\n",
    "A peer-to-peer exchange, on the other hand, can support trading using any traditional payment method, in any location of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this document, I will demonstrate a way in which Kusama can be integrated on a peer-to-peer exchange, with no need for the end user to hand over their private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will show the cryptography underlining the process in a proof-of-concept fashion, and back this document up with tests for each individual process.\n"

    "A trade on LocalCoinSwap has 3 participants: the buyer, the seller, and the arbitrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important at this point to distinguish also between the creator of the trade offer (the *maker*), and the responder to the trade offer (the *taker*). A seller can be a maker or a taker of a trade offer, as can the buyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive trade example involves the seller as the maker, and the buyer as the taker. The seller signs up to LocalCoinSwap, and then creates an offer which advertise their desire to sell Kusama. The offer will specify terms and conditions of potential trades, such as the price, payment method, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buyer also signs up to the platform, and responds to the sellers offer to create a *trade request*. Once the seller accepts the request, the trade begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point a Kusama multisignature address is generated, using the addresses of the buyer, seller, and arbitrator. The seller prepares a transactions and places the funds in the multisignature escrow address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buyer then pays the seller directly according to the conditions of the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "After receiving payment, the seller then performs a special Kusama *approveAsMulti* transaction. This transaction specifies that they are giving permission for funds to travel from the escrow address to the buyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the address is multisignature, a second approval is required. The buyer has no Kusama yet to create a second approval, so instead the arbitrator performs a Kusama *asMulti* transaction, giving the second lot of approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point the funds move automatically from the escrow address to the buyer, and the trade is complete. Feedback will be exchanged, and both parties move on - the buyer in posession of the Kusama, and the seller in posession of the local currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the funds are in a multisignature address requiring 2/3 approval, and only the seller possesses his/her private keys, it is impossible for LocalCoinSwap to steal the funds from the users on the platform. It is also impossible for one party to defraud the other and escape with the cryptocurrency, because in a dispute the arbitrator can decide who receives the cryptocurrency.\n",

    "Following this abstract, I will demonstrate in full the blockchain functionality involved in conducting such a non-custodial trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will then cover all possible edge-case situations, such as disputes between the buyer and seller, or cancellation requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I will demonstrate related cryptography required in the running of an exchange, such as gathering fee information, checking validity of published transactions, and dealing with error situations."
